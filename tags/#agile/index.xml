      <description>You are in the midst of exploring the mobile app when it suddenly crashes.
You don’t recollect what sequence of actions exactly made it crash. You try to remember and execute the same steps again but in vain. The app doesn’t crash anymore!
Things going on in your mind :
How would you identify what had caused the crash? What if it doesn’t crash anymore? What if you missed keeping track of the steps you performed on the system/app?</description>

      <description>With the interest to know more, for the curiosity to discover, we explore&amp;hellip; Roads, Code, Apps.. Exploratory testing is all about discovering the unknown. I have written before on why we should conduct exploratory testing.
Let’s discuss what to bear in mind when conducting effective Exploratory Testing!
There are quite a few misconceptions when it comes to how Exploratory testing is conducted. It’s not the same as exploring the roads. We are not wanderers when we explore the app.</description>

      <title>Service Virtualization - When integration points are a dependency for development</title>

      <description>Being dependent on is nothing but relying upon. One has to wait for that other thing to get the task at hand started/completed.
If Dependencies are not resolved or not made available, the task cannot be started/completed.
If dependencies are made available, much of the testing from QA &amp;amp; Dev at a component level, Unit level, can “shift left,” or be moved earlier in the SDLC. This is because each component can be tested individually instead of waiting for complete assembly.</description>

      <description>The Final product should work as expected.
Everyone wants to create the product that customers (and their customers) love. The product should be:
 As per customer’s expectation - Solution Fit &amp;amp; Market Fit Defect-free Early to market / without delays Within budget Changes post-go-live should be based on further feedback from customers  Is it possible to achieve all above? Yes - With the help of acceptance criteria!!

      <title>Finding Defects V s Preventing Defects</title>
      <link>https://www.vaishalidesarda.com/quality/finding_defects_preventing_defects/</link>

      <description>Finding defects involves verifying after the software is created. Fixing defects involves re-doing the faulty code and then re-testing everything to ensure that the fix is in place and that nothing else got broken. This takes time and money. Preventing defects is easier, and needn&amp;rsquo;t take a lot of upfront analysis either if certain practices are followed.
Prevention is better than cure. Preventing the defects before the product is built (coding phase) helps deliver business value earlier.</description>
