      <description>Being dependent on is nothing but relying upon. One has to wait for that other thing to get the task at hand started/completed.&#xA;If Dependencies are not resolved or not made available, the task cannot be started/completed.&#xA;If dependencies are made available, much of the testing from QA &amp;amp; Dev at a component level, Unit level, can “shift left,” or be moved earlier in the SDLC. This is because each component can be tested individually instead of waiting for complete assembly.</description>
