      <description>Some actions/events are so natural that we do not realise if we are in the moment or not!
While repeatedly working on the same thing, that walk to the grocery store or brushing the teeth maybe or making the bed for that matter.
Does this kill awareness or observation power?
What happens once we automate the test cases/scenarios/ideas?
 Do we look back? Do we regularly go through with our eyes at least once just to make sure there is nothing extra we should add even if asserts are passing?</description>
