      <description>Murphy’s Law states - “Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong!” - but do you know how it’s going wrong? What if it doesn’t go wrong again? What if you can’t make it go wrong again?

      <description>Finding defects involves verifying after the software is created. Fixing defects involves re-doing the faulty code and then re-testing everything to ensure that the fix is in place and that nothing else got broken. This takes time and money. Preventing defects is easier, and needn&amp;rsquo;t take a lot of upfront analysis either if certain practices are followed.
Prevention is better than cure. Preventing the defects before the product is built (coding phase) helps deliver business value earlier.</description>
