      <description>Finding defects involves verifying after the software is created. Fixing defects involves re-doing the faulty code and then re-testing everything to ensure that the fix is in place and that nothing else got broken. This takes time and money. Preventing defects is easier, and needn&amp;rsquo;t take a lot of upfront analysis either if certain practices are followed.&#xA;Prevention is better than cure. Preventing the defects before the product is built (coding phase) helps deliver business value earlier.</description>
