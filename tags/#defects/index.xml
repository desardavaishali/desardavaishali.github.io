      <description>You are in the midst of exploring the mobile app when it suddenly crashes.
You don’t recollect what sequence of actions exactly made it crash. You try to remember and execute the same steps again but in vain. The app doesn’t crash anymore!
Things going on in your mind :
How would you identify what had caused the crash? What if it doesn’t crash anymore? What if you missed keeping track of the steps you performed on the system/app?</description>

      <description>Sounds weird right?! QA signing off on known defects for a release!
Should it happen?
If yes, when?
If no, what might happen?
This is quite a frequent scenario in these days of quick releases, early-to-market approaches.
Also, keeping the QA position aside, one needs to understand that it is impossible to create and release new software that works 100% of the time.
Finding a defect in Production by the customer is expected, and we - as in the project team / client - already have a process around on how to deal with it.</description>
