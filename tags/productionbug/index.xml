      <description>Yes, the aftermath. That’s where the game resumes.  The update is released.. A Few days pass by fine and we suddenly start getting reports of a few things not working as we promised. “Production issue” they call it.
And even before we know the root cause, the famous ritual of ‘Why did the Tester not find it’ starts.

 some configs the redirect URLs Cache clearing after logout Time-zone consideration Performance handling Some change of a code to fix a regression issue  And many more unrelated to business functionality itself.</description>
