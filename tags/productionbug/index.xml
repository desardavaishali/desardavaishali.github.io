      <description>Yes, the aftermath. That’s where the game resumes. The update is released.. A Few days pass by fine and we suddenly start getting reports of a few things not working as we promised. “Production issue” they call it.&#xA;And even before we know the root cause, the famous ritual of ‘Why did the Tester not find it’ starts.&#xA;Well the production bug could be because we missed:&#xA;some configs the redirect URLs Cache clearing after logout Time-zone consideration Performance handling Some change of a code to fix a regression issue And many more unrelated to business functionality itself.</description>
