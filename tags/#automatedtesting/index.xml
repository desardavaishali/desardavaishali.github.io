      <description>Recently, I came across a scenario where all the Xamarin forms for the app had an update. This resulted in issues like static text being cut off, not being visible, changes in colors for a few buttons’ state, etc on different kinds of devices.
Will automation catch such changes?

      <description>Offline testing of an online app!? If an app expects to be online, then, of course, it’ll not work offline! Whatever is there to test offline!?
Like I’d written recently, Testing is much more than merely validating Business Acceptance Criteria. A Tester helps see the app from the end user’s point of view and provides feedback to improve the quality and helps polish the user experience.
Having a great experience online and offline is one of the key points of engaging users in-app.</description>
