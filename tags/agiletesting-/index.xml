      <description>Customer/Client: “We are now agile. There is no QA in an agile team. Developers can do their own testing. Why should I pay for a QA? I don’t need one!”&#xA;These days Developers build automated tests and integrate code-based tests as well by using various frameworks (e.g. mocks). Some developers follow the Test Driven Development approach and code all the tests, find where their fix breaks the code, as they don’t like QA finding the defects.</description>
