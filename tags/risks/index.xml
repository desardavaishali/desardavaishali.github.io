      <description>Developers pouring ideas on how to test! Sounds familiar? How does it get perceived? Does such input make you feel - Upset, responsible, frustrated, offended?
As a Tester, you might think “Why should someone supervise or control on how you prepare for your task or how to do the testing?”
I find it alright if Devs or anyone from the team is suggesting how to experiment or what to Test.</description>
