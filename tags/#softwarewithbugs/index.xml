      <description>Sounds weird right?! QA signing off on known defects for a release!
Should it happen?
If yes, when?
If no, what might happen?
This is quite a frequent scenario in these days of quick releases, early-to-market approaches.
Also, keeping the QA position aside, one needs to understand that it is impossible to create and release new software that works 100% of the time.
Finding a defect in Production by the customer is expected, and we - as in the project team / client - already have a process around on how to deal with it.</description>
