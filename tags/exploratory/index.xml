      <description>It’s 2020, and the pandemic is going on. Everyone (at least from the IT industry) is working from home. Conferences and meetups are virtual and free to some extent or at an economical cost.
In all these forums,
 We chat about testing as a craft. How to be agile, how to explore &amp;amp; Experiment, session-based testing, state-based testing, automation just checks, it’s not testing. We prefer test ideas over test cases, or we write minimal test cases.</description>

      <description>With the interest to know more, for the curiosity to discover, we explore&amp;hellip; Roads, Code, Apps.. Exploratory testing is all about discovering the unknown. I have written before on why we should conduct exploratory testing.
Let’s discuss what to bear in mind when conducting effective Exploratory Testing!
There are quite a few misconceptions when it comes to how Exploratory testing is conducted. It’s not the same as exploring the roads. We are not wanderers when we explore the app.</description>

      <description>Yes, you read it right. I’m talking about “Hearing, and not listening”. While the world is focusing on listening as a skill, I want to draw attention to hear. The basic ability of ours. While listening requires focused attention, anything you overhear can be beneficial too!
Being a tester, the information I have is never enough. I always end up seeking new details.
While I was attentive in meetings, my basic hearing ability has been of a lot of use post meetings.</description>
