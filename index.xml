      <description>Intuition.
We name it Intuition when : We apply gut feeling We are certain that this path is important (even if it‚Äôs not spoken of in acceptance criteria/specifications), We apply judgement - things we cannot determine directly nor measure, or even wish to go against the measure/data. We sense something is not valid when we test.
While you test, there comes a scenario, you know something is not right. You do not have the confirmation, but again your gut instinct tells you to explore further.</description>

      <description>Recently, I came across a scenario where all the Xamarin forms for the app had an update. This resulted in issues like static text being cut off, not being visible, changes in colors for a few buttons‚Äô state, etc on different kinds of devices.
Will automation catch such changes?
Before we conclude, let‚Äôs pause and reflect - ‚ÄúIs this the purpose of automation?‚Äù ‚ÄúDo we write automation to detect such issues?</description>

      <description>It‚Äôs 2020, and the pandemic is going on. Everyone (at least from the IT industry) is working from home. Conferences and meetups are virtual and free to some extent or at an economical cost.
In all these forums,
We chat about testing as a craft. How to be agile, how to explore &amp;amp; Experiment, session-based testing, state-based testing, automation just checks, it‚Äôs not testing. We prefer test ideas over test cases, or we write minimal test cases.</description>

      <title>When Should We Stop Testing</title>

      <description>After reading this headline, you must be thinking ‚Äúwhy does one need to write an article on this! It‚Äôs straightforward - Your test cases are passed, there are no open high priority or high severity bugs, the story is signed off by PO and you are done!‚Äù
No, my friend.
There is more to this.
To ensure that the application ‚Äúmeets the requirements‚Äù and also to ensure that ‚Äúearlier requirements that were met, have not been undone‚Äù, one takes the approach of validating that the requirements of the software are known and are being met.</description>
