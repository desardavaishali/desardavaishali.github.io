      <description>Intuition.
We name it Intuition when : We apply gut feeling We are certain that this path is important (even if itâ€™s not spoken of in acceptance criteria/specifications), We apply judgement - things we cannot determine directly nor measure, or even wish to go against the measure/data. We sense something is not valid when we test.
While you test, there comes a scenario, you know something is not right. You do not have the confirmation, but again your gut instinct tells you to explore further.</description>
