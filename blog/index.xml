      <description>Yes, the aftermath. That’s where the game resumes. The update is released.. A Few days pass by fine and we suddenly start getting reports of a few things not working as we promised. “Production issue” they call it.
And even before we know the root cause, the famous ritual of ‘Why did the Tester not find it’ starts.
Well the production bug could be because we missed:
 some configs the redirect URLs Cache clearing after logout Time-zone consideration Performance handling Some change of a code to fix a regression issue And many more unrelated to business functionality itself.</description>

      <description>Intuition.
We name it Intuition when : We apply gut feeling We are certain that this path is important (even if it’s not spoken of in acceptance criteria/specifications), We apply judgement - things we cannot determine directly nor measure, or even wish to go against the measure/data. We sense something is not valid when we test.
While you test, there comes a scenario, you know something is not right. You do not have the confirmation, but again your gut instinct tells you to explore further.</description>
